I can't directly create binary content like a JPG image through text output. However, you would normally place an appropriate image file in the `astro-bitdoze-starter/public/images/` directory.

For a welcome image, you would typically want:
- A professional-looking business image
- Dimensions around 800x600px or similar 4:3 aspect ratio
- Optimized for web use (file size under 200KB)

You'll need to manually add an image file to this location, or use a placeholder service like:
