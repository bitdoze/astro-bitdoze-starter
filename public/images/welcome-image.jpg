I can't create a binary JPG image file through text output. You would need to add an actual image file to your project at this location:

astro-bitdoze-starter/public/images/welcome-image.jpg

You could either:

1. Use a placeholder image service in your component:
   - Update the Welcome.astro component to use a placeholder URL like:
   `src="https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Welcome+Image"`

2. Download a suitable stock image and place it in that location

3. Create a placeholder image with design software and save it to that path

The image should ideally be professional-looking with dimensions appropriate for the component (around 800x600px or similar 4:3 aspect ratio).
